# LONG LANG
## Logan's Obscure 'n Good Language

An easy programming language based on English. 

I built this language in a way I can understand to assist me with coding projects of my own. I used a mix of CoPilot (regretted it), Qodo, and ChatGPT to build the compiler and interpreter. This was mainly because my coding skills are terrible. I've attempted to learn on my own and struggled. So, I decided to use an AI to build the basics of my language. It ain't much, but I'm glad it turned out well, and its really helped me learn the basics of programming.

(The Compiler and Interpreter were generated using AI)
